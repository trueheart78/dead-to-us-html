# Dead to Us

A fun, html-only site focused on keeping track of those who have left us too soon.

Because when you leave, you're... _dead to us_. :heart:

![dead-to-us][dead-to-us-gif]

## Details

Just a raw HTML site.

## Icons

To add a fresh new icon, visit [Emojipedia][emojipedia], and look for something relevant. Currently, the preferred style for graves are the Google style. It will require updating of the style sheet.

### Association Logic

- If someone has left the company, they should be assigned a `grave-coffin`.
- If they have simply gone to another team, then they should be assigned a `grave-ghost`.
- If they are promoted within the same vertical (meaning they are in your chain-of-command), then they are considered a `grave-vampire_boy` or `grave-vampire_girl`.
- For those on retainer (like myself), `grave-zombie_boy` or `grave-zombie_girl` is preferred.
- `grave-skull` was the classic icon, and is still available, for times where the prior logic doesn't apply.

Custom one-off's are allowed. `grave-robot` was added just for such an occasion. :robot:
